<h1>Create a flyer in Microsoft Word</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Did you know that you can create professional flyers using Microsoft Word in Microsoft 365? Word offers a range of customizable options and templates that you can easily download and edit from the Microsoft 365 database. I recently tried out a dog walker's template and managed to complete a flyer in under 10 minutes. If I can do it, so can you! Let me show you how simple and user-friendly the process can be.

Feel free to adjust and customize the text further to suit your desired tone and style.

I found this side hustle template. You can either open in Microsoft 365 or download and use your own word processor.

It's just that easy. You can also use your own images. I added my own images to the flyer on the right and also changed the table cell colors.
